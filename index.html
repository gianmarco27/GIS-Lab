											<h2>Data Collection</h2>

									<li>
										<span class="icon solid major style1 fa-map-marker-alt"></span>
										<h3>Multipath</h3>
										<p>Many collected points had too poor accuracy and needed to be relocated, due to both the multipath effect and the fact that all the surveyling had to be performed with mobile phone sensors.</p>

										<h3>Discontinuous Fragments</h3>
										<p>Often small buffers and some data were discontinuous, in the same road id we could have discrepancies and therefore decide which data to keep for PLOS elaboration.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        Since it was our first time working on this kind of data, some sorts of adjustments to the data was required to perform the computation and rapresentation,
                                        the roadlinks provided for Niguarda were divided in different segments with sometimes different 'source_id's near intersections and crossings, 
                                        this was unknown at the time of surveyling and therefore some points data had to be taken from the road these fragments belonged to.
                                        <br/>In addiction to this, since Qgis was unstable while performing some operations of data matching, we used some python scripts to generate tables for PLOS computation.
                                        During the creation of the WEB-GIS to perform the desired styling and customization some trial and error had to be performed to correctly make use of OpenLayers provided tools.
